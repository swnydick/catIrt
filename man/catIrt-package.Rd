\title{An R Package for Simulating Computerized Adaptive Tests (CATs)}
\description{
\code{catIrt} provides methods for simulating Computerized Adaptive Tests,
including response simulation, item selection methods, ability estimation methods,
and test termination methods.  Unique in \code{catIrt} is support for the graded
response model (and, soon, other polytomous models) along with expanding support
for classification CAT (including an implementation of the SPRT, GLR, and CI methods).
